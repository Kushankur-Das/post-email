# README for postemail.php

This file is intended to be used as a server-side script that will receive data from an HTML form and send an email message containing that data.

## Usage

Assuming that your webserver is running PHP, you can use this script on your website by following these steps:

1. Download `postemail.php` to your server.
2. Change the configuration variables at the beginning of the file to match your needs.
3. Create an HTML form on your website with input fields that correspond to the variables you set in `postemail.php`.
4. Set the `action` attribute of your form to the URL of `postemail.php`.
5. Make sure your form fields have the correct names to match the variables defined in `postemail.php`.

When the form is submitted, `postemail.php` will capture the user's input data, format it into an email message, and send it to the specified recipient(s).

## Configuration Variables

The following variables at the top of `postemail.php` should be customized to fit your particular website and usage scenario:

* `$to`: the email address(es) where the message should be sent.
* `$subject`: the subject line of the email message.
* `$redirect_url`: the URL to redirect the user to after the message has been sent (optional, can be left blank).
* `$form_fields`: an associative array that maps the names of form fields to the labels you want to include in the email (e.g. `'name' -> 'Name'`).
* `$required_fields`: an array of field names that are required for the form to be submitted successfully (can be left blank).

## Notes

* This script uses the PHP `mail()` function to send the email message. Be sure your server is properly configured to allow this function to work.
* Make sure that any sensitive information (such as email passwords or API keys) is not included in this file or publicly available on the server.
* For added security, consider adding input validation and sanitization to the form handling code in `postemail.php`.
